### AutomationML Editor Skin

The **Aml.Skin** provides icons and styles to design a user interface providing the same look and feel as the [AutomationML](https://www.automationml.org) editor. AutomationML is a standardized data exchange format, developed to support the data exchange in automation systems engineering. The AutomationML editor has been developed by the AutomationML association in order to visualize major AutomationML concepts and provides functionality to visualize, create and edit AutomationML/CAEX files. The AutomationML editor is suited for educational purposes and a perfect entry point for learning, experimenting and understanding AutomationML.

The **Aml.Skin** can be used by AutomationML editor plugin developers to adapt the plugin UI design to the editors UI design. It supports theming for dark and light themes and is based on [MahApps.Metro](https://mahapps.com).
